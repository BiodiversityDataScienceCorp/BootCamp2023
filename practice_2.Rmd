### Practice with
- Packages
- Accessing specific columns in a data set
- Assigning variables
- Filtering


1. Install and load the tidyverse and palmerpenguins packages. 
```{r}

```


2. Assign the bill length column to a variable called penguinBillLength
```{r}

```


3. Assign the bill depth column to a variable called penguinBillDepth. 
```{r}

```


4. Create a subset of the data that includes male Gentoo penguins with flipper lengths greater than 20 mm. 
```{r}

```


5. Create a subset of the data that includes all penguins on Biscoe island with flipper lengths greater than 20 mm. Remove all of the NA values as well. 
```{r}

```
